I strive to create software that not only functions efficiently under the hood, but also provides intuitive, pixel-perfect user experiences.</p>
                        <p class="about-text">I encourage myself to learn new and better ways to create seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful with people that bring out the best in me.</p>
